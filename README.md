In this project I used React as a frontend, ASP.NET API as backend and MS SQL Server as database connected by EntityFramework.

Database is hosted so to test this project you just need to clone it

How to view this project:

Requirements : 
Visual studio 2022 ,Node

Start visual studio ,click "Clone a repository" and use this link https://github.com/Nelever/Net-React-SupportCenter.git .

You can use user account with login: 1test@gmail.com password: 1234 or create new one.

To test moderator account login: 2345 password: 1234 .

This is project of support center where users with some kind of problem can get help from moderators. User account can create ticket and send messages to moderator inside it. Moderator account can view tickets, assign them to itself and answer the user messages. When problem is solved moderator can close ticket so no one can send messages inside it.
