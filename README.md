In this project I used React as a frontend, ASP.NET API as backend and MS SQL Server as database connected by EntityFramework.

This is project of support center where users with some kind of problem can get help from moderators. User account can create ticket and send messages to moderator inside it. Moderator account can view tickets, assign them to itself and answer the user messages. When problem is solved moderator can close ticket so no one can send messages inside it.
